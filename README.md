# unity-experiments

A repository for some of my experiments with the [Unity](https://unity.com) real-time development platform. Most make use of free assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/?aid=1100lIqr),[^1] which may or may not be included in the repo.

A few of these practice projects are [playable online](https://play.unity.com/u/theDrake), including:

- [_Carnage_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/carnage-j) (a [Vehicles](https://github.com/theDrake/unity-experiments/tree/master/Vehicles) experiment): Score points (and take damage) for every collision. Survive as long as you can!
- [_Tanks_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/tanks-t33): A simple yet intense deathmatch game!
- [_Battle Ball Z_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/battle-ball-z) (a [Ball](https://github.com/theDrake/unity-experiments/tree/master/Ball) experiment): Roll around, jump around, and use a variety of interesting power-ups to withstand an ever-growing onslaught and remain atop the tower!
- [_Breakout_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/breakout-43): Classic brick-breaking action!
