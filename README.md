# unity-experiments
A repository for some of my experiments with the [Unity](https://unity.com) real-time development platform. A few are playable online:

- [_Carnage_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/carnage-j) (a [Vehicles](https://github.com/theDrake/unity-experiments/tree/master/Vehicles) experiment): Avoid vehicles and obstacles to survive as long as you can!
- [_Tanks_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/tanks-t33): A simple yet intense deathmatch game!
- [_Battle Ball Z_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/battle-ball-z) (a [Ball](https://github.com/theDrake/unity-experiments/tree/master/Ball) experiment): Roll around, jump around, and use a variety of interesting power-ups to withstand an ever-growing onslaught and remain atop the tower!
- [_Breakout_](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/breakout-43): Classic brick-breaking action!
