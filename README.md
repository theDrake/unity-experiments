# unity-experiments

A repository for some of my experiments with the [Unity](https://unity.com) real-time development platform. Most make use of free assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/?aid=1100lIqr),[^1] which may or may not be included in the repo.

A few of these practice projects are [playable online](https://play.unity.com/u/theDrake), including:
